### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Automation tasks and other snippets
Check out my [gists](https://gist.github.com/rgpower).  You might find them interesting for cloud-automation tasks and other random things.

## Now
I am now working at CBN in R&D using Azure Cloud!  My job title is Cloud Architect, but I've been in the business for over 25 years.  I am equally comfortable at all stack levels, from 802.1Q VLAN encapsulation to VMs, SQL, noSQL, Containers, Cloud Functions, Cloud Messenging, IAM, Otel spans, and more. I have built production systems using Java, python, C++, C, Javascript, T-SQL, PL/SQL, OpenAPI, and more.

## The Past
Other interesting places I worked include:

* [Celtx](https://www.celtx.com/), where I worked for 10 years as a Senior Systems Programmer and jack of all trades using AWS and Google Cloud Platform.  I am very proud of my work at Celtx, and I think the founders would agree that I played a key role in both the success of the product from a cloud and DevOps perspective, and even played an important role in the cloud due-diligence related to their [recent acquisition by Backlight](https://www.celtx.com/news/celtx-backlight-acquisition.html).
* [Verafin](https://verafin.com/) ([recently acquired by NASDAQ](https://verafin.com/news/nasdaq-completes-acquisition-of-verafin/)), where I used AI/ML to build fraud detection analytics for their FRAMLx solution
* [Collaborative Network Technologies (ColabNet)](https://web.archive.org/web/20010603075603/http://www.colabnet.com/news.htm) for 10 years, where I was a co-owner for most of that.  I was so proud of the work we did at Celtx; so many cutting edge research projects, for example:
  * [Satellite Bandwidth Reservation Booking system](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Telecommunications_Integrated_Applications/Reserve_your_own_bandwidth)
  * [Ship-to-shore learning management system](https://artes.esa.int/news/project-tests-satellite-applications-sea)
  * [CDPD-based mobile home care system](https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/43121/CST%202001.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).

In addtion to cutting edge research projects, I was instrumental in helping several multinational businesses in the Atlantic Provinces acheive their technical goals:
 * [Oracle Corporation - I represented Consilient in Redwood City, CA as principal integration architect on BlackBerry integration with Oracle Collaboration Suite](https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/oracle-e-mail-product-gets-blackberry-support/21608)
 * Michelin Canada - I was laboratory instructor for J2EE training in WebSphere technologies and tutored local Nova Scotia staff on Michelin's own "Xnet Framework".
 * SUN Microsystems - both as a subcontractor for J2EE/ANTLR work, and a presenter for J2EE tutorials.

## My first web deployment and subsequent job:

In 1996, after learning of the web for the first time, I built and deployed [likely one of the very first public facing WWW Servers (at Memorial University](https://web.archive.org/web/19970425132506/http://rupert.physics.mun.ca/)). Back then, the number of active websites were measured in the 1000s, whereas now [over 10,000 new websites created every day](https://siteefy.com/how-many-websites-are-there).

Shortly after my web server deployment, I won a job competition posted on USENET, and I found myself responsible for the setup and maintenance of the [Canadian Technology Network's first website](https://web.archive.org/web/19990117073758/http://ctn.nrc.ca/ctn/news.html), hosted on a SUN Microsystems UltraSPARC.  It was there, under a very talented DBA that I learned how to program, write CGI scripts, and use these scripts to integrate third-party systems (like Oracle and cc:Mail), back before PCs even had TCP/IP stacks (remember Novell IPX/SPX, token ring?)
